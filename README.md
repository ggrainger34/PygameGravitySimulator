# Gravity-Simulation

Small program to simulate gravity under Newton's laws of Gravitation using Euler's method, implemented in python with the pygame module.
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2) and works by cycling through each body and working out the forces affecting it. 
The program is fairly unoptimised - further improvements could involve adding a quadtree or moving to a faster language.
